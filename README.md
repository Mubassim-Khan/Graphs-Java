# Graphs-Java
This Repository contains programs of Graphs in Java, which contains programs of Dijkstra, Floyd & other algorithms as well as sort and other methods for implementation of DFS and BFS in Graph using Stack and Queues for better understanding the graphs programs.

## Programs Description:
1. Program 1: Program to demonstrate the adjacency list & matrix representation of the graph
2. Program 2: Implement DFS and BFS in Graph using Stack and Queues.
3. Program 3: Program to find shortest path from a given source to all the approachable nodes (Single source shortest path Dijkstra’s algorithm).
4. Program 4: Program to find shortest path between all the source destination pairs (All pairs shortest path Floyd’s algorithm). 
5. Program 5: Program to arrange all the nodes of a given graph (Topological sort).
  
## Features
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm: To find the shortest path from a given source to all the approachable nodes.
- Floyd's Algorithm: To find shortest path between all the source destination pairs.
- Stack & Queues: Concept Stack and Queues are used to implement Breadth First Search & Depth First Search.
- Topological Sort: To arrange all the nodes of graph.
- Searching: Breadth First Search & Depth First Search is used to search the node's element more efficiently.
- Efficient: Recursion reduces runtime complexity as well as seperate functions are made to run program more efficiently.
